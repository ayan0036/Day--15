Explanation How Mongoose Handles Validation: 

Mongoose automatically validates data before saving a document to the database. When we define a schema, we can add validation rules like required, minlength, or unique. Before the document is saved, Mongoose runs these validations and throws an error if any rule is violated. 

The .validate() method is used internally before .save() to check if the input follows schema rules. If validation fails, Mongoose sends a meaningful error which can be caught using a try-catch block in our route.
